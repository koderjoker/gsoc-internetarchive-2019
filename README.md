### Introduction

The Internet Archive is a non-profit library committed to Universal Access to Knowledge. In its 23 years of operation, the Internet Archive and its community have archived millions of web pages, books, texts, audio tracks, videos, images, and software (and thus, have rescued them from being lost to history). These items are made freely available to the public to consume and repurpose through the Internet Archive’s flagship website, Archive.org.

Because of the Internet Archive, millions of patrons from all over the globe now have a chance to access media which their local libraries and archives have never held or made access to them before. However, having the right content is not good enough. It is imperative that users are able to easily navigate through this content to find and view what they are searching for, regardless of the device used or disabilities that they may have to contend with.

Thus, my goal for this Google Summer of Code was to “Improve site navigation for archive.org” through researching, prototyping and developing relevant components and features at <a href="https://github.com/internetarchive/iaux">IAUX</a>, the Internet Archive’s monorepo for Archive.org UX development and prototyping.

### Before Google Summer of Code
I have always been in love with books, ever since my childhood. However, it was very difficult to find titles I wanted to read since there has been, and still is, a severe dearth of good libraries in India.

Come my later years in high school when I fell in love with coding and college where I fell in love with development and open source culture. I soon started to search for an open source project that interested me, and where I could volunteer.

Thus I chose to begin my experience with volunteering at an open source organisation by contributing to Openlibrary, the world's largest non-profit, open source, digital public library, by merging a pull request for a linting issue as part of Hacktoberfest in October. I became a regular contributor January onwards, and started attending Openibrary's community calls. I helped out by re designing and implementing our book list pages, book edition component, search pages and raising and resolving issues for navigation and accessibility. 

Soon I branched by helping out in helping in component development and documentation at IAUX, and applied for Google Summer of Code in the same.
