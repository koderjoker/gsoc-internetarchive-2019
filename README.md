### Introduction

The Internet Archive is a non-profit library committed to Universal Access to Knowledge. In its 23 years of operation, the Internet Archive and its community have archived millions of web pages, books, texts, audio tracks, videos, images, and software (and thus, have rescued them from being lost to history). These items are made freely available to the public to consume and repurpose through the Internet Archive‚Äôs flagship website, Archive.org.

Because of the Internet Archive, millions of patrons from all over the globe now have a chance to access media which their local libraries and archives have never held or made access to them before. However, having the right content is not good enough. It is imperative that users are able to easily navigate through this content to find and view what they are searching for, regardless of the device used or disabilities that they may have to contend with.

Thus, my goal for this Google Summer of Code was to ‚ÄúImprove site navigation for archive.org‚Äù through researching, prototyping and developing relevant components and features at <a href="https://github.com/internetarchive/iaux">IAUX</a>, the Internet Archive‚Äôs monorepo for Archive.org UX development and prototyping.

### Before Google Summer of Code
I have always been in love with books, ever since my childhood. However, it was very difficult to find titles I wanted to read since there has been, and still is, a severe dearth of good libraries in India.

Come my later years in high school when I fell in love with coding and college where I fell in love with development and open source culture. I soon started to search for an open source project that interested me, and where I could volunteer.

Thus I chose to begin my experience with volunteering at an open source organisation by contributing to Open Library, the world's largest non-profit, open source, digital public library, by merging a pull request for a linting issue as part of Hacktoberfest in October. I became a regular contributor January onwards, and started attending Open Library's community calls. I helped out by redesigning and implementing our book list pages, book edition component, search pages and raising and resolving issues for navigation and accessibility. 

Soon I branched out by helping in component development and documentation at IAUX, and applied for Google Summer of Code in the same.


## Google Summer of Code


### Flattening the directory structure and cleaning up the repo
I kickstarted my Google Summer of Code journey by focusing on flattening our directory structure, ensuring that all examples ran in storybook, closing resolved issues and helping out by reviewing and merging in pull requests pending pre gsoc to pave way for our upcoming tasks. To implement the same, I became familiar with storybook and studied our pre existing components and their working. 

Along with the above, a new component for the tracklist by a volunteer was successfully reviewed and merged in. I researched on the possibility of creating a separate component for our svgs as proposed by another volunteer, made an attempt for the same and discussed the pros and cons for the same in our user experience forum.

### Redesigning the search result card system
The archive‚Äôs uneven search tile system has been one of its greatest obstacles to accessibility and navigation, and thus was one of my sub goals to tackle. 

For the same I did an in-depth study of the current situation of our tiles and listed all its issues that would be needed to be resolved. I studied Sketch and the use of its various plugins and coordinated with our UI and UX engineer Jim to build a strategy to tackle the tile designs and improve my workflow in Sketch. 

I decided to first work towards equalising all cards heights, followed by replacing our information messages with badges and solving colour contrast issues in our colour palette. I presented the latest version of the prototypes in our biweekly user experience forum and kept adding on small tasks, reiterated on and redesigned the tiles multiple times based on continuous review and feedback until the final prototypes were confirmed and approved.

Final prototypes for height standardisation and redesigning the information overlay can be found <a href="https://github.com/internetarchive/iaux/issues/195#issue-456375923">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/internetarchive/iaux/issues/196#issuecomment-514803299">here</a>!

### Building the Internet Archive's music player
Building the youtube channel for our music player in React was the biggest task I undertook, and I spent most of my Google Summer of Code period on its development, enhancement, testing and bug fixing; getting it ready for its ship to production.

My main task was to build the youtube wrapper component and integrate it in the bigger music player component. I met up with Isa to break down our task and decide what aspects to prioritise. Our first aim for the youtube wrapper was to integrate the YouTube iframe api and replace the default embedded, synchronise with our tracklist component, handle youtube player errors gracefully and to autoplay the video and shift track accordingly. I was also given full reign to make changes in multiple existing parent and child components of the music player to accommodate the same. 

I picked out parts from the youtube iframe api documentation that would help us in our endeavour, noted down legal/technical difficulties that building youtube player would face and rediscussed them with Isa. I made notes and sketched out the flow of data, relevant components, files and variables to keep track of all necessary changes. I reduced lines of codes/complexity by writing the most elegant solution possible and replaced legacy lifecycle methods.

Once I created a stable version of the component, I discussed existing issues on error handling, state management, integration hiccups with the main music component and possible refinements for the music player with Isa. Isa also gave me access to her BrowserStack account for testing purposes. Thus we went through numerous cycles of testing and bug fixing in order to make it meet user experience expectations. I made a tasklist to tick off in the main pull request to keep track.

We discussed the state of the music player at different points of time with Jim, and he created a document to list Music Player specs to meet before our player could move to production. Discussion for the music player occurred in multiple one-on-one calls, updates on the same were given in stand up calls and feedback was asked for in our user experience forum.

The music player finally shipped to production on August 10 üéâ

### Researching React testing libraries/utilities for component testing
When the youtube player reached its first stable state, I started to write tests in Jest for the same. However, it soon became apparent that the currently used testing library (react-test-renderer) wasn‚Äôt optimal for our use, and thus I spent some time studying the pros and cons of using `react-test-renderer`, `enzyme` and `react-testing-library`. 

This was a rather unique study as there were no straightforward and clearcut comparisons between the 3 libraries/testing utilities online and the endeavour required me to deep dive into the documentation. I also explored the libraries‚Äô chats, github comments and issues of repositories that chose to use any of the libraries and related blogposts of developers. In the end I determined that using react-testing-library would be the best for our purposes.

Summarised points and references can be found <a href="https://github.com/internetarchive/iaux/issues/226">here</a>. I plan to elaborate on the same through an article in the near future.


### Building the mobile topnav

Working and enhancing the topnav was something I was interested in from the start, due to the huge potential in improving it and resolving its multiple existing accessibility and navigational traps.

After a call with Isa, we agreed that I was to build the new mobile topnav using LitElement, and we consulted Jason who had prior experience in building the archive‚Äôs radio player with the same. Afterwards I had a meeting with Jim who introduced me to the workings of the prototype of the mobile topnav, and I broke my work down into smaller issues to tackle one by one. I set up my environment and studied css animations and LitElement in preparation. I also surveyed and researched implementations on other websites and studied best accessibility practices for developing website navigational features.

After a couple of issues faced due to pre-existing issues with the navbar, I had a brief discussion with Isa, and it was decided to 
- Build the navbar from scratch with minimal code and discard the previous code. Later on, build a new desktop nav, thus extend the mobile topnav‚Äôs utility
- Rewrite the styles from scratch due to the large amount of unused css and the unexpected styles caused due to it
- Removing Bootstrap as a dependency for new components in IAUX due to it‚Äôs unwanted effects on self written styles and pre-existing accessibility issues

I soon had the navbar done and the pull requests are being reviewed and merged one by one!

Along with the above, I helped out with occasional code reviews and user experience testing of other pull requests. I synced with the rest of the IAUX team in our standup meetings, biweekly user experience meetings and occasionally in sprints.


### Benefits to Internet Archive
As found out through Google Analytics,
- The music player saw 23.3k+ views, within 11 days (August 11- August 22) of its ship to production, and the youtube player was the most interacted with channel
- Out of the Internet Archive‚Äôs past year‚Äôs 98 million visits, approximately 60.1 million were from mobile, thus the topnav‚Äôs ship to production would be a huge win for the Archive‚Äôs navigation and accessibility

Additionally,
- Switching our testing libraries is bound to result in easier testing for developers, better test coverage and thus less bugs for our users
- Users of all devices are bound to benefit from our redesign of the tile system


### What I took away from the experience
My Google Summer of Code experience has undoubtedly been an amazing experience and has not only helped me grow as a developer, but also as an individual. Not only did I learn new technologies and gain further mastery over previously known ones, but also I‚Äôve become a better communicator and a more confident person.


### Future work and involvement in the community
In the immediate future, I plan to iterate on my work on the mobile topnav and make revisions to it based on feedback to help it reach production, and later on extend its utility to desktop as well. I'm also interested in helping out with the book sponsorship program.

I would also like to continue helping out newcomers and support any upcoming open source initiatives, as Hacktoberfest was my entry to the Internet Archive.
